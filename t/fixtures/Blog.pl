          q|I'm often introduced to new groups of people. Traveling, new contracts, and otherwise just being personable, present situations wherein people must deal with my presence.  I make an effort to treat everyone equally, no matter their social or professional position. I make an equal effort to execute appropriate proportions of irreverence; just enough to release the tension that tends to develop in groups of people. It develops because people are cesspools of fear.  That fear isn't always immediately apparent; it reveals itself, for the most part, in anger and unmet expectation. Sometimes, no, many times, I am victim to that fear. I can feel it bubbling inside me, coercing me to poise for an impending attack.|,
